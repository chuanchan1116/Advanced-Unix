# Homework #1
## Compile
### Build
```
make
```
### Run
```
./hw1 UID GID
```
* The program can be runned with the sample configuation.

### Clean
```
make clean
```

## Usage
Just the same as the homework spec.

```
cat {file}:              Display content of {file}.
cd {dir}:                Switch current working directory to {dir}.
chmod {mode} {file/dir}: Change the mode (permission) of a file or directory.
                         {mode} is an octal number.
echo {str} [filename]:   Display {str}. If [filename] is given,
                         open [filename] and append {str} to the file.
exit:                    Leave the shell.
find [dir]:              List files/dirs in the current working directory
                         or [dir] if it is given.
                         Minimum outputs contatin file type, size, and name.
help:                    Display help message.
id:                      Show current euid and egid number.
mkdir {dir}:             Create a new directory {dir}.
pwd:                     Print the current working directory.
rm {file}:               Remove a file.
rmdir {dir}:             Remove an empty directory.
stat {file/dir}:         Display detailed information of the given file/dir.
touch {file}:            Create {file} if it does not exist,
                         or update its access and modification timestamp.
umask {mode}:            Change the umask of the current session.
```

* If the argument numbers does not match with the spec, the shell will prompt the usage of the command.
* If something wrong happened when executing the command, an error message will display.

## Notice
* Most of the command is implemented with the `unistd.h`, so the behavior of the command depends on the kernel. Ex: `rm` is implemented with `unlink` system call; it is garunteed to raise an error `EISDIR` (non-POSIX value) when removing a directory in Linux since 2.1.132.
* Most of the error message is generated by the predefined messages in libraries, and may different between libraries versions or locale settings.

## Known issue
1. When `find dir`, it will fail if not finding current directory.
2. `umask` may fail for directories cause directory can only have at most `755`.
